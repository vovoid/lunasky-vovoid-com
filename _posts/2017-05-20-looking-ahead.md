<h2>Welcome</h2>
...to our development blog! This is the first of a bunch of blog posts about what has been going on over the past 1.5 years.

Who are the developers working on Luna Sky? 

We are 2 people:
<ul>
    <li>jaw - engine & game code</li>
    <li>Yaphy - graphics & game design</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release</h2>

Releasing Luna Sky 1.0 was the result of 4 years of spare time work. However, the finished product was not as good as we would have wanted it to be.
As reviews began coming in, some things were pretty apparent and needed to be addressed. We don't believe in abandoning our
projects for the next when things don't turn out as good as expected, a game can have a life span of 10 years or more.

What we managed to do with the project was a lot though, we went from nothing to a useful game engine and processes for content
creation and delivery. We designed and released a game with 5 distinct worlds with mostly custom music for each one.
 
Unfortunately we got a bit rushed towards the end and had to cut some features, and most importantly, testing. 
This hurt the product really bad, and unfortunately we also had a deadline to meet, so we had to release what we had. 
When we realized we were not happy, and we cut most marketing. To the users who despite this have enjoyed the game - thank you, we hope
you will like the upcoming update which you will receive by just owning the game on Steam.

What we have built is definitely worth building on, so we have continued to work on Luna Sky.

<h2>Future focus</h2>
The areas we have decided to focus on in the upcoming patch are a lot:
<ul>
    <li>Luna's design</li>
    <li>The intro</li>
    <li>The first level</li>
    <li>Balance between cutscenes and gameplay</li>
    <li>Load times</li>
    <li>The lack of enemies & bosses</li>
    <li>Some more gameplay elements for a more varied experience</li>
    <li>Finishing our initially planned story elements</li>
    <li>Better support for Windows</li>
</ul>

Each of these upcoming features will be addressed in this blog.

This all seems like a lot, doesn't it? Why didn't we release incremental patches? 90% of these things change a lot of backend things
and depend on each other so we feel it's better to release it all at once. 
 
So, in closing, we hope you will enjoy some of the posts in this blog! Some will be a bit technical perhaps, but we'll try to keep them fun to read!
